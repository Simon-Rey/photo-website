# Patterns

Patterns are everywhere: we build self-similar buildings, the tree grows branches
that grow branches in turn, we mimic the behaviour of the others. 
There is something fascinating in patterns, something strangely comforting. 
Knowing the patters of your city makes you feel at home,
does regularity make you feel safe?
