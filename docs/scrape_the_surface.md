# Scrape the Surface

The building is getting old, let's add a new layer of concrete.
The kitchen tiles are too annoying to remove, let's build on top of them.
What seems one is often composed of many layers.
Layers after layers, we hide away previous design, construction material, shameful drawings.
<span style="font-style: italic;">Scrape the Surface</span> celebrates all the glimpses we get
at the unknown layers.
