# Somewhere up in the Sky

The sky always feels empty but if you know where to look at you can find hidden gems.
There is way more to see than just a big dipper, even from big cities.
Below are some of the astrophotographies I've taken. Some were taken in Amsterdam,
some others in secluded places in the south of France.
