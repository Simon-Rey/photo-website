# The Other Side of the Mirror

There is something weird with these photos. Sometimes they are just a bit too blurry.
Sometimes the light does not come from the right direction.
Sometimes the sky looks like the sea, or is it the other way around?

The series <span style="font-style: italic;">The Other Side of the Mirror</span> presents
the viewer with scenes that seem plausible at a first glance but whose credibility do not
survive further inspection.
